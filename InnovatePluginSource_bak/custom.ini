[OutputChannels]
    ;OutputChannels have to basic forms:
    ; 1) Controller Channels - values contained in the runtime data stream recieved from the controller.
    ; 2) Expression based Channels - new channels based on any other channels or Constant using 
    ;    mathematical operations and TunerStudio functions.
    ; Type one are primarily used by Firmware developers, type 2 can easily be user extensions.
    ;
    ; Type 1 format for scalar:
    ; channelName      = scalar, dataType,    offset, "Units",   scale, translate
    ;   channelName can be any alphanumeric string. It must start with a letter and contain no special characters or white spaces.
    ;   dataType will be U08, S08, U16, S16, U16, S32 or F32. For F32
    ;   offset - the index of the 1st byte in the read datastream, this can be numeric or key words nextOffset and lastOffset
    ;   scale and translate will be applied to the raw value using the standard formulas: 
    ;      msValue   = userValue / scale - translate
    ;      userValue = (msValue + translate) * scale
    ;   Also of note, scale and translate can be expressions, units can use String function expressions
    ; Example:
    ;   seconds          = scalar, U16,    0, "s",   1.000, 0.0
    ;
    ; Type 1 format for paramClass bit 
    ;   channelName = bits, dataType, offset, bitsOfInterest
    ; Examples:
    ;   ready            = bits,   U08,   11, [0:0]
    ;   crank            = bits,   U08,   11, [1:1]
    ;   startw           = bits,   U08,   11, [2:2]
    ;   warmup           = bits,   U08,   11, [3:3]
    ;   tpsaccaen        = bits,   U08,   11, [4:4]
    ;   tpsaccden        = bits,   U08,   11, [5:5]
    ;
    ; 6 bit fields defined from 1 byte at offset 11. 
    ; the bits of interest are described in the format [n:m] where n is the starting bit and m the last bit.
    ; in the above examples, n=m so each channel is a single bit.
    ;
    ;
    ; Type 2 format:
    ; channelName = { someExpression }, "Units"
    ; someExpression can be made up of any set of constants and OutputChannels using any 
    ; of the TunerStudio operators and functions. 
    ;
